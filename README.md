Coco* is an application dedicated to a fast-food restaurant, or precisely a Bubble Tea shop.

Story: During my journey in China, i was impressed by how easily we can order in Chinese restaurants/shops and how easily people can have access to the products informations directly with their Smartphone.

Select iPhone X/XS size on firefox to see the mobile render (there is no Desktop render yet)

Developping with Vue.jS and Node.JS/Express.JS

* Coco is a trendmark. It is actually an official restaurant WorldWide. The design of this application isn't related to the officials Coco applications. It is used just to a personal project. If, i will be used in the future, everything will be renamed and the official Coco logo will be removed.
